## Sponsorship Packages

The following table details the core sponsorship levels. We have several different packages that offer different levels of visibility, but all will show your organisation's support of the Django Community, both on the screen during the conference, in printed materials.

Gold sponsorship and above includes a booth, which will be placed in the Assembly Rooms' main ballroom, alongside the stations that will provide food and drink at various points during the conference. Gold sponsorship and above will also feature at the start of each talk when they are published on YouTube and thus provide excellent visibility outside of the conference itself.
