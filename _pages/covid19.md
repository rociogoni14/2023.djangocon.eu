We are committed to holding a safe event for all attendees.  

We expect attendees to be mindful of health and considerate to others during the event. This includes having
up-to-date vaccinations, and observing all reasonable precautions.  We request that all attendees take a
self-administered test* prior to attending the conference, regardless of symptoms.

Although there are currently no legal requirements to wear face masks at events such as conferences, we
strongly recommend (and politely request) that all our attendees wear masks whenever possible, and
particularly when moving around the building.

Free face masks will be available at the registration desk if you need one (but please still bring your own).

Please do not attend the conference if you are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. 

We will offer full refunds to attendees who are unable to attend the conference.

*Lateral Flow Tests are available at most pharmacies.  The nearest pharmacies to the Assembly Rooms are
